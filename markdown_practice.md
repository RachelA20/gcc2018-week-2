# Markdown Practice

This is Markdown. It is a way for you to format code in an easily readable way. 

## Headers
You can create different size headers. You have 6 total sizes you can choose from, which you typically want to use for semantic purposes. To create a header, add a # in front of the text. The number of # signs determines what size header you create.

> ## Header 2 (h2)
> ### Header 3 (h3)
> #### Header 4 (h4)
> ##### Header 5 (h5)
> ###### Header 6 (h6)
